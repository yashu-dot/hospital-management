# hospital-management
The hospital Management system uses database technology to construct, maintain and manipulate various kinds of data about a person’s medical history and care across time. The DBMS can track and update all the information of registered patients
This helps us in planning, and coordinating patient care in both inpatient and outpatient settings.
How this database works?
1.A patient medical record is registered on the first visit to the doctor.  
2. A patient can make many appointments with one or more doctors. 
3.A doctor can accept appointments with many patients. 
4.However, each appointment is made with only one doctor, and each appointment references a single patient  
5. If an appointment yields a visit with a doctor, the visit yields a diagnosis and, when appropriate treatment. 
6.With each visit, the patient’s history will be updated. 
7.Each visit creates a bill. 
8.Each patient visit is billed by one doctor, and each doctor can bill many patients
9. Each bill must be paid. However, a bill may be paid in many instalments, and a payment may cover more than one bill. 
10.A patient may pay the bill directly, or the bill may be the basis for a claim submitted to an insurance company. 
11. If an insurance company pays a bill, the deductible is submitted to the patient for payment.
